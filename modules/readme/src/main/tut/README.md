# Droste

Droste is a recursion library for Scala.

# Usage

```tut
1 + 1
```

Refer to the included example project [athema](athema). Athema is a
math expression parser/processor that demonstrates several common
recursion schemes.

# Credits

A substantial amount of Droste's code is a derivation-- or an
alternative encoding-- of patterns pioneered by others. Droste has
benefited from the excellent work in many other recursion libraries,
blog posts, academic papers, etc. Notably, Droste has benefited from:

- [recursion-schemes](https://github.com/ekmett/recursion-schemes)
- [Matryoshka](https://github.com/slamdata/matryoshka)

Thank you to everyone involved. Additionally, thanks to Greg Pfeil
(@sellout) for answering my random questions over the last few years
while I've been slowly learning (and using recursion) schemes.
